# Challenge 1: App with Emoji-Only UI

<img src="../assets/emojis.png" width="700" alt="Emojis">

## Themes
- Build with Chainguard Containers
- Get weird

## The Challenge
Build a fully functional application where the entire user interface uses ONLY emojis. No text allowed in any interactive elements - buttons, navigation, labels, everything must be emojis. Extra points if, like, everything is emojis.

## Requirements
- All UI elements must be emojis only (no text in the interface)
- Ideally the app will actually do something
- Must be containerized using Chainguard Containers. You can set it up with a Dockerfile and we'll build and run locally. If it's a web app, it should able to be run on some port and be seen locally. If it's a CLI app, we'll run the default entrypoint and go from there. Feel free to give us directions in the README (replace this file).

## Dumb Ideas

Stuck? Here are some derivative ideas!

- Calculator (🔢 ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗)
- To Do app (✅ ❌ 📝 🗑️)
- Weather app (☀️ 🌧️ ❄️ 🌡️)
- Music player (▶️ ⏸️ ⏭️ 🔀 🔁)
- Mini game (🎮)
- Demonic energy detector (😈)
- Beanie baby collection database / sorter (🐢🧸, topical!)

## Submission
To submit, simply replace the contents of this folder (round_1) with the code for your project. Make sure to replace this README.md with instructions on getting your project running. Also make sure your vibelympics repository is public and that you've pushed all the code you want us to see. We will pull in your submission directly from your repository.
